# Enclosures for Specter-DIY

There are a few case designs made by the community:

## SeedSigner's "Barebones" enclosure, v2

Updated design from @SeedSigner (Twitter/Telegram) with a smaller form factor & MicroSD access.

The printable .STL files for v1 and v2 are available for download from the [docs/enclosures/seedsigner](./seedsigner/) folder.

You can also buy the v2, or a fully assembled Specter-DIY, from [his shop](https://btc-hardware-solutions.square.site/).

(E.U. residents can contact @surfacePlasmon (Twitter) or @daz21 (Telegram) to purchase an enclosure via mail or visit diynodes.com)
